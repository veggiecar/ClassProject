# ClassProject

The run_analysis.R file is r script that is meant to meet the requirements of the Coursera.org
class, Getting and Cleaning Data.  This class is part of a series of classes designed to prepare a student in the various 
facets of Data Science.

The class requires a course project which states:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The project requires the student to download a data set which can be found at
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
on the world wide web.

Within the downloaded zip file one will find .txt files that hold the raw data which will be manipulated by the 
run_analysis.R script.  The files that will be used are: X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, X_train.txt, 
Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt. These file must be placed in the working directory.

The data in the Inertial Signal folders will not be used by the run_analysis.R script.

Additionally included in the previously mentioned zip file will be a README text file, features info text file, 
features text file and an activity file.  All of which can provide background information on the information 
generated by the run_analysis.R script

The run_analysis.R file will:
