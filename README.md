# ClassProject

The run_analysis.R file is r script that is meant to meet the requirements of the Coursera.org
class, Getting and Cleaning Data.  This class is part of a series of classes designed to prepare a student in the various 
facets of Data Science.

The class requires a course project which states:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The project requires the student to download a data set which can be found at
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
on the world wide web.

Within the downloaded zip file one will find .txt files that hold the raw data which will be manipulated by the 
run_analysis.R script.  The files that will be used are: X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, X_train.txt, 
Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt. These file must be placed in the working directory.

The data in the Inertial Signal folders will not be used by the run_analysis.R script.

Additionally included in the previously mentioned zip file will be a README text file, features info text file, 
features text file and an activity file.  All of which can provide background information on the information 
generated by the run_analysis.R script

The run_analysis.R file will:

intially work with the testing observations:
creates an empty dataframe to hold testing data specifying column names of
raw data row number, test or train, subject, activity, mean, standard deviation
read measurement data text file into data frame
read activity text file into data frame
read subject text file into data frame
put the subject df into test_df subject activity column
put the word test in all rows of the column train or test
calculate the mean of each row in test_df
put mean of each row of raw data into mean column of test data frame
put the activity df into test_df activity column
use a for loop to replace activity code with actual activity name
compute the standard deveiation of each row of test_df
put standard deviation computations into standard deviation column of test_df
create an array of a sequence of numbers
put those numbers into Raw data row number column of test_df

the above will be repeated for training observations

combine testing data frame and training data frame

create an empty dataframe to hold summarized data naming the columns and the rows
create array for the choices in the activity column
using a for loop for each column of the newly created data frame
create a subset for each subject that is being examined
loops through the six separate activities of the subject being examined
creates a subset of the activity being examined of the subject being examined
calculates the average standard deviation of all the tests of the activity/subject being examined
calculates the average mean of all the tests of the activity/subject being examined 
puts the average mean in the correct cell of the data frame
puts the average standard deviation in the correct cell of the data frame
prints the summary_df to a text file residing in the working directory
